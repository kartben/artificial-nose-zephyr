# Artificial Nose - Zephyr version

This repository contains a complete rewrite of https://github.com/kartben/artificial-nose using
Zephyr RTOS.

The overall functionality is the same (it even uses the exact same TensorFlow model as the previous
version), but the code has been rewritten from scratch to take advantage of Zephyr's features, in
particular:

- Use multiple threads, each one handling a specific task (ex. sensor reading, model inference,
  Graphical User Interface, etc.)
- Use zbus to communicate between threads
- Use LVGL to create the graphical user interface, using native widgets such as charts and meters.
